All descriptions below refer to data in both `stdmeanresults` and `full.tidy`, however, full.tidy contains averages of all data based on subject and activity. 

All data for this dat set come form the accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals. These contain time domain signals (prefix t) and Fast Fourier Transform results (prefix f). The time domain signas were caputured at a constant rate of 50Hz. In addition, Jerk singals were obtained using body linear acceleration and angular velocity. The following may have measurements in x, y, and z dimensions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
